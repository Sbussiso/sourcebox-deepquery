# DeepQuery

<br/>
<br/>

> DeepQuery is your solution for turning static data into dynamic, actionable insights. With DeepQuery, you can effortlessly connect your data packs and interact with your customized AI chatbot, enabling you to extract valuable information, explore complex data sets, and gain deeper understanding from your resources.

<br/>

> DeepQuery is different than DeepQuery Code. The main difference is DeepQuery Code is for github projects and code related files while DeepQuery is for everything else.

<br/>

### How it works

> DeepQuery connects directly to your structured data packs, allowing you to ask complex questions and get relevant responses based on the content within these packs. By utilizing a vector search algorithm, DeepQuery identifies and retrieves the most pertinent data points, helping you find exactly what you’re looking for with minimal effort.

<br/>

### Switch back and fourth between packs quick and easy

> DeepQuery makes it very easy to change packs and subjects. just click on ***"Use pack data"*** and select a different pack than the ones you are using.
> ***Packs are optional***, you do not need to use any data at all to use DeepQuery! Just select ***"No Pack"*** to use Deepquery with no added data!

<br/>

### Query your data with or without AI intervention.

> ***Query your data with a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can now query your data with a chatbot. The chatbot will use your data as the context for all of your quiries. 

<br/>

> ***Raw query your data directly without a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can query just your pack data without a chat model! Once you enter your query you will recieve the vector search algorithm results of your query displaying the relevent bits of your data.

<br/>

> ***Note:*** If you select ***"No Pack"*** you cannot preform a raw query. Raw queries can only be performed with pack data.

<br/>

### Choose a selection of AI generated prompts or use your own custom ones.

<br/>

### Generated

> Dont know what prompt to use? No worries just use one of ours! DeepQuery offers a variety of pre-generated AI prompts to help you explore your data effortlessly. These prompts are designed to cover a broad range of scenarios and typical queries, making it easy for you to engage with your data even if you’re new to the platform or unfamiliar with the content.

<br/>

>  Simply browse through the available options and select a prompt that fits your needs. Whether you’re looking to get a quick summary, identify key insights, or dive into specific sections of your dataset, these AI-generated prompts provide a solid starting point to get the most out of your data without needing to craft a detailed question yourself.

<br/>

### Custom

> To create more tailored and specific interactions, you can use the Custom Prompt feature to craft your own queries. This allows you to go beyond the standard AI-generated prompts and ask questions that are directly relevant to your unique data and research needs.

<br/>

>  To get started, simply select the ***“Custom Prompt”*** option, type your desired question, command, or prompt into the input field, and submit it to the chatbot. The AI will then analyze your input using the context provided by your selected data pack, delivering responses that are finely tuned to your request. This flexibility enables you to explore complex topics, retrieve detailed insights, or address highly specific use cases that may not be covered by the default prompts.

<br/>

> Custom prompts are ideal when you want precise answers, perform in-depth analysis, or interact with your data in a way that aligns with your specific project requirements.
