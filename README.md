# DeepQuery

<br/>
<br/>

> DeepQuery is where you put your data to work! Effortlessly connect your packs to DeepQuery and and enjoy your customized AI chatbot connected to all of your pack data.

<br/>

> DeepQuery is different than DeepQuery Code. The main difference is DeepQuery Code is for github projects and code related files while DeepQuery is for everything else.

<br/>

### Switch back and fourth between packs quick and easy

> DeepQuery makes it very easy to change packs and subjects. just click on ***"Use pack data"*** and select a different pack than the ones you are using.
> ***Packs are optional***, you do not need to use any data at all to use DeepQuery! Just select ***"No Pack"*** to use Deepquery with no added data!

<br/>

### Query your data with or without AI intervention.

> ***Query your data with a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can now query your data with a chatbot. The chatbot will use your data as the context for all of your quiries. 

<br/>

> ***Raw query your data directly without a chatbot***. Once you select your pack of choice, you can query just your pack data without a chat model! Once you enter your query you will recieve the vector search algorithm results of your query displaying the relevent bits of your data.

<br/>

> ***Note:*** If you select ***"No Pack"*** you cannot preform a raw query. Raw queries can only be performed with pack data.

<br/>

### Choose a selection of AI generated prompts or use your own custom ones.

> Dont know what prompt to use? No worries just use one of ours! With DeepQuery you can simply select one of the generated prompts.

<br/>

> To use your own custom prompts select ***"Custom Prompt"*** and enter your own custom prompts to the chatbot.
